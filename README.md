# Quick travel

Simple mod that adds balanced tp commands.

## Commands
These commands can only be executed when you're near any spawn point (world spawn, your bed, someone else's bed).

### `/spawn`
Teleports you to spawn.

### `/home`
Teleports you to your spawn point (bed).

### `/tpa <player>`
Sends a request to teleport you to the player's bed.

That player can either accept the request with `/tpaccept` or deny it with `/tpdeny`.  
Teleport request automatically gets cancelled after 120 seconds if ignored.
