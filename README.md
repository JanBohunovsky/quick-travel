# Quick travel

Simple mod that adds balanced tp commands.

## Commands
### `/spawn`
Teleports you to spawn if you're near your spawnpoint (bed).

### `/home`
Teleports you to your spawnpoint if you're near world spawnpoint.

### `/tpa <player>`
Sends a request to teleport you to the player's spawnpoint.

That player can either accept the request with `/tpaccept` or deny it with `/tpdeny`.  
Teleport request automatically gets cancelled after X seconds if ignored.
